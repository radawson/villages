# Overview

This is a plugin is being used to learn the plugin creation process for Paper, so provide detailed explanations and background for changes.
Add detailed comments and complete docstrings to document the structure and intent of the build.
Work carefully, and provide extra feedback and ask extra questions to make this a highly collaborative process.
Favor native Paper API usage over third party or Bukkit API calls when available.
Use kyori adventure text over older methods.
All versioning is done via gradle.properties and propagated using build.gradle.kts at compile time.
